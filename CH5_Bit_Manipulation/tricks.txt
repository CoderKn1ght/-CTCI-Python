CTCI
1)multiplying a number by 2 (x * x) is equal to left shifting by one
2) multiplying a number by 4 (x * x * x * x) is equal to left shifting by two
generalisation: multiplying a number by 2 is left shifting by 2
and for deviding right shift by
3) XOR with negation of itself is always true
4) To drop n bit from right side, do and with negation of 0 left shifted n times
